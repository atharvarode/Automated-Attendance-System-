# Automated Attendance System

![Automated Attendance System Demo](demo.gif)

This project implements an Automated Attendance System using five different models: Simple CNN, Complex CNN, VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet Inception. It utilizes OpenCV for face detection and comparison of model accuracies. The system is deployed using a Flask application. The dataset contains 17 different classes for attendance tracking.Name of the detected person is stored in a csv file along with the timestamp.

## Introduction

The Automated Attendance System aims to simplify attendance tracking by automating the face detection and recognition process. It leverages machine learning models to identify individuals and provides accurate attendance records.
