This project implements an Automated Attendance System using five different models: Simple CNN, Complex CNN, VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet Inception. It utilizes OpenCV for face detection and comparison of model accuracies. The system is deployed using a Flask application. The dataset contains 17 different classes for attendance tracking.Name of the detected person is stored in a csv file along with the timestamp.

## Introduction
